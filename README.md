I’m an energetic and self-motivated full-stack web developer and web site design enthusiast.

I am a detail-oriented, deadline-conscious problem solver with previous more than 10 years’ software development experience in building interactive web applications from mockup to deployment. As a web developer, I have built dynamic web applications utilizing HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript, jQuery, AJAX, responsive design, JSON, RESTful APIs, Bootstrap, Handlebars.js, Firebase, cookies, local storage, Node.js, Express.js, React.js, MongoDB, MySQL, Sequelize, MVC, Heroku, and Github. 

I have built interactive fully customized websites with WordPress, including Woo Commerce integration and setting up the branding of the website using Adobe Photoshop and Affinity Photo. Some samples of my client’s websites are available at https://www.businessonwww.com/portfolio/ . 

I’m a thoughtful decision maker with an excellent organizational and interpersonal skills, ability to remain calm and focused during difficult situations, and willingness to go the extra mile to accomplish objectives.

I love technology and everything about it. I am very impressed I know is hard to accomplish. The sense of accomplishment when solving a really complicated problem cannot be beat! I love to code because it is a team effort and it makes a difference in peoples’ lives.

I’m excited to continue cultivating my technical knowledge and to contribute meaningfully to impactful technological advancements that improve our everyday lives.
